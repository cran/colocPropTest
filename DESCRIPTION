Description: Colocalisation analysis tests whether two traits share a causal
  genetic variant in a specified genomic region. Proportional testing for
  colocalisation has been previously proposed
  [Wallace (2013) <doi:10.1002/gepi.21765>], but is reimplemented here to
  overcome barriers to its adoption. Its use is complementary to the fine-
  mapping based colocalisation method in the 'coloc' package, and may be used in
  particular to identify false "H3" conclusions in 'coloc'.
